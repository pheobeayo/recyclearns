# Product Name: Greenearns (Tokenized Recycling Rewards Platform)

- ## Project Category: Applications in climate change and sustainable carbon reduction 

## Product Overview:
Greenearns is a decentralized marketplace application designed to incentivize and empower individuals, recyclable material sellers, recyclable centres, companies and other buyers to actively participate in sustainable waste management and recycling efforts. By leveraging blockchain technology, Greenearns connects sellers offering recyclable materials with buyers in a transparent and rewarding ecosystem. Sellers list their recyclable materials/products while the buyers make purchases of these recyclable products using blockchain (the environment and payments using kii). 
The users (the sellers and buyers) are rewarded with a token in the form of Greenearns points (GRP), which upon accumulation to a certain amount can be exchanged for a valuable token and used to purchase eco-friendly products, services, or carbon offset certificates.

## Problem Statement:
Efficient waste management and recycling remain a significant challenge worldwide. Finding recyclable materials for purchase and motivating sellers to participate in recycling efforts are persistent issues. There is a lack of transparency and incentives to drive recycling participation effectively. These challenges hinder progress in mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable carbon reduction goals.

## Proposed Solution:
Greenearns addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized marketplace for recyclable materials, integrating blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions, and introducing a tokenized reward system in the form of GRP. The product leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize waste management and recycling, creating a solution that not only encourages participation but also promotes sustainability and environmental consciousness.
